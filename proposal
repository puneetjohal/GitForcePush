Final Project Proposal
2018-05-29 T

(possibly a parody of) Plants vs. Zombies
Objective:
- to defend your house against the zombies using plants that shoot seeds at them
- upgrade your plants to defend your garden against more and more powerful waves of zombies by using in-game currency (sun energy)
- collect experience with each wave and use it to level up power attacks (tentatively)

We plan to make use of:
- Superclasses and subclasses for specific types of plants and specific types of zombies
- Processing to develop graphics
- Tree data structure for skill tree
- ArrayLists to store game history and stats

At minimum our goal is to:
- Have functioning graphics where zombies move across the screen and plants in the garden shoot at them and deplete their health, after which they die and disappear from the screen
- Have at least 5 waves of zombies that get progressively harder
- Have at least 3 different types of plants and three different types of zombies
- Have sun energy that replenishes as you play and can be used to upgrade your plants

Extras:
- Day/night mode
- Lawnmower as a final defense that gives you one more chance if zombies do make it to your house
- Skill tree + power attacks / power-ups 
- Extra graphics and developed storyline


Backup ideas:
- Zombie FPS - Protecting your camp from waves of zombies using a watergun. You use your mouse to aim and click to fire, and press space to zoom.

- Pokemon - very simplified version of Pokemon where you can catch, train, and battle pokemon
