# PokemonPond #
 A simple Pokemon game adaption in processing, where you can catch Pokemon or visit the local gym, hospital, or shop.
 You can train your pokemon by fighting with wild pokemon, so that you can beat the local gym Pokemon.

 
# How It Works #
  Our projects uses processing methods, such as importing images, to replicate the environment of Pokemon games. We also uses
  several abstract data structures , such as heaps and queues. The minHeap stores wild pokemon to ensure that the pokemon
  encountered are catchable. The wild pokemon will appear when the player is on a location with grass. The queue stores the
  pokemon that the player has caught so that the strongest pokemon will be sent out first to increase chances of victory. 
  
  There are also several visible buildings on the screen. When at the entrance of any of those buildings, the player
  will be allowed to "enter" and access the features inside. For example, at the hospital, the player can heal their pokemon,
  at the shop, you can buy or sell pokeballs, and at the gym, fight a boss pokemon.
