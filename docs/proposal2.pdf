Pokemon

Objectives:
- To explore different environments to catch new Pokemon
- To train your Pokemon and become gym leader
- To catch em all

We plan to make use of:
- Superclasses and subclasses for different kinds of Pokemon and their evolutions
- Processing to develop graphics
- Tree data structure for evolution trees
- ArrayLists to store stats and other List-type data, such as the Pokedex

At minimum our goal is to:
- Have at least four different environments for the player to explore and at least one evolution chain of Pokemon that can be found in each
- Have a hospital where the player can heal their Pokemon and a gym where they can battle their Pokemon
- Make use of graphics to show an actual player moving across the screen and into different environments

Extras:
- Fully fleshed out battles with Pokemon encountered in the wild and in gyms, where you can chose attacks and powerups
- Menus for the Pokedex, hospital, and gym
- More pokemon and more environments
- A storyline
- Increased chances to encounter and catch certain Pokemon in the wild the better you have trained your Pokemon
- Game ends when you catch em all

Backup ideas for our backup idea:
- Rebuild game - trying to take back land from zombies and expanding your survivor camp by allocated resources to different tasks
- Tower defense style game - like bloons
